1.  User's Guide
----------------

Notes for Different Operating Systems

This User's Guide was written based upon the DOS version of MKS Toolkit. Please 
make the following considerations when using Toolkit on a different platform.

Some sh examples are wrong for OS/2 and NT.  For example, there is no switch 
command on  OS/2, so all options to OS/2 commands should be specified with 
/ (slash)  rather than - (hyphen).

Page 65 Awk Tutorial: Introduction:

The manual states that a book entitled The AWK Programming Language is included 
in the MKS AWK package.  This book is not included with MKS Toolkit.

Page 96 AWK Tutorial: 5.2 The if Statement:

After the statement:

   An if statement is an action of the form
   if (expression) statement1 else statement2

please add:

   NOTE: When the else statement2 part of the if statement is on the same line 
         as the statement1, the else statement2 should be separated from the 
         statement1 by a semicolon (;).

   Remember that \t is the escape sequence for a tab character.



2.  Reference Manual
--------------------

Additional Man Pages

There is no printed man page for the new Toolkit command mksdiag(1). This man 
page is provided online with version 4.2.
There is no printed man page for the Toolkit command dircmp(1).  This man page 
is provided online with version 4.2.  
MKS Toolkit for DOS News support comes with several new man pages.  Some man 
pages are included in the MKS Toolkit News Manual, and some are included online 
with version 4.2.

alias(1) Man Page

The Synopsis line is incorrect.  It should list the -tx options as not 
required:  [-tx] instead of -tx.

--- 

cpio(1), dd(1), pax(1), and tar(1) Man Pages

In each of these man pages, remove the comments mentioning MKS Toolkit for NT 
does not support raw device access.  Raw device access now is supported in MKS 
Toolkit 4.2 for NT.  To reference a raw device, you must prefix the device with 
the notation //./, as follows:
                       //./a:     instead of a:
                       //./TAPE0  instead of TAPE0
Note that this convention is documented in the on-line man pages, but not in 
the printed versions.

---

man(1) Man Page

The Synopsis lines are incorrect.  They should show that the -w and -x options 
are only allowed in the absence of -k, and -k is required for keyword searches.
The correct synopsis lines should be:
man [-wx] [-M path] [section] entry ...
man -k [-M path] keyword ...

---

touch(1) Man Page

The Synopsis line is incorrect.  It should list the -t option as [[-t] time], 
not [-t [time]].

---

ulimit(1) Man Page

This man page is missing the -a option.  The -a option shows all current limits.

---

ascii(5) Man Page

The second and third tables in this man page are missing the IBM character set 
glyphs represented by the listed numbers.  This will be fixed in a future print 
of the Toolkit Reference.

---

vipc(5) Man Page

In the Set Option Variables section, the discussion of attributes needs more 
clarification for the OS/2 Toolkit.  All attribute settings require an extra 
four digits for OS/2, and an attribute setting would appear as follows:
   0x14000000   Gives a red foreground on a green background
The existing format is valid for MKS Toolkit for DOS.

Page 4, Before You Begin:  1. System Requirements

Change the Operating System requirements in Table 1 from "DOS 2.1 or later" to 
"DOS 3.1 or later".
Also, add a comment here that states that MKS Toolkit only supports machines 
with a 80286 processor or greater.
