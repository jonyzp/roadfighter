    Some simple answers to common questions about MKS Toolkit

Question: Can I install MKS Toolkit in a subdirectory, such as
c:/mks?

Answer: Yes; if you specify the subdirectory for the installation
program, this will be handled automatically.  If you manually
install MKS Toolkit, you must set up the ROOTDIR environment
variable correctly.  See the discussion of ROOTDIR in the
Configuration Manual.

Question: Why doesn't your xyz utility behave the same as the one
on my UNIX/SunOS/AIX/Ultrix/HP-UX/Berkeley/whatever system?

Answer: The behavior of MKS Toolkit programs is governed by the
following (in order):

 1. POSIX.2

 2. Existing Practice (notably System V and BSD)

There may be additional differences due to limitations of NT.

Question: Why is MKS Toolkit awk different from the one on my
UNIX system?

Answer: There have been two major versions of awk written by Aho,
Weinberger, and Kernighan (the original authors).  The second
version, sometimes called `new awk', is, with minor exceptions, a
superset of the first.  New awk is described in The AWK
Programming Language by Alfred V. Aho, Peter J. Weinberger, and
Brian W. Kernighan, Addison-Wesley, 1987.  MKS AWK is based on
the version described in this book, and includes all of the new
features that have been added.  Unlike new awk, however, MKS AWK
is designed to run almost all `old awk' scripts without change.

Question: My makefiles don't seem to work, and I can't find
anything wrong with their contents.  Why does this happen?

Answer: Make requires each line in a recipe to start with a
literal TAB character.  Some editors automatically expand TAB
characters to spaces when saving a file.  If your editor does
this, you can try one of three things:

  * Many editors allow you to disable the TAB expansion feature.

  * You can use an editor such as Vi or ED which saves TAB
    characters as TABs.

  * The MKS Toolkit command unexpand converts spaces into TAB
    characters.

Question: Why can't I find the ex editor, the egrep program, or
the fgrep programs?

Answer: ex is the same program as vi.  vi knows that when it is
called under the name of ex, it should run as a line-oriented
editor; when it is started as vi, it runs as a screen editor.

Similarly, fgrep and egrep are the same program as grep.  Like
vi, the programs check to see how they were called, to determine
the way they should behave.  The automatic installation program
writes a copy of the vi program to both $ROOTDIR/bin/vi.exe and
ROOTDIR/bin/ex.exe .  Similarly, the other programs we've
discussed are installed under all the appropriate names.
Therefore if you have used the automatic installation procedure,
you should already have the appropriate copies in your
$ROOTDIR/bin directory.

If you do not have all the programs you expected, you probably
used the manual installation procedure.  We recommend that you
refer back to the manual installation process (Configuration
Manual) and follow the instructions given there for installing
programs under multiple names.

Question: When I try to send mail to a user on my machine, why do
I get the message: "Unable to open mailbox"?

Answer: The most common reason that a user's mailbox cannot be
opened is that there is a directory with the same name as the
user's system mailbox.  For instance, mail to the user terry is
normally stored in the file terry in the system mailbox, usually
c:/usr/mail.  If terry is a directory, the mail programs cannot
open it for writing, as they would a file.

Remove the directory with the user's name from the system
mailbox.

Question: I installed MKS Toolkit, everything appears to be fine.
Now when I type bc to start Borland C++, the machine appears to
hang.

Answer: The machine is probably not hung.  There is a new utility
bc as of MKS Toolkit 3.2.  bc is a programming language which can
perform arithmetic calculations to arbitrary precision.  Use the
command:

   which bc

to determine which file is actually executed when the command is
typed.  Change the PATH variable or rename one of the files to
get the desired behavior.

                      ____________________


Question: The speaker on my machine is loud.  This is
annoying since any error in vi results in a loud beep.
Can I turn it off?

Answer: Yes. In your ex.rc file, add this line:

   set noerrorbells

or

   set noeb

Question: Why do I get a `temporary file error' when I try
to use vi?

Answer: More often than not, this occurs when vi cannot
find a place to create its temporary work file.  The
normal place for vi's work file is in the directory
specified by the TMPDIR environment variable.  When vi
attempts to create a work file, it first looks for the
directory specified by the TMPDIR environment variable; if
TMPDIR is not specified, vi looks for a TMP environment
variable.  If TMP is not defined, vi checks for the
directory $ROOTDIR/tmp, and then for /tmp on the current
drive.  If none of those exist, vi gives the error message
and terminates.

If you have several drives on your system, you should
consider defining the variable TMPDIR.

Question: Is there any way to speed up tar commands?

Answer: It is often possible to speed up a tar command by
specifying a block size for the command.

The best results seem to occur when the block size is
equal to the capacity of a single diskette cylinder.  In
other words, tar will read an entire cylinder at a time
from the diskette.  For example, a 360K diskette contains
nine sectors per track, and two sides, giving 18 blocks
(sectors) per cylinder.

The following table gives example tar commands for the
common diskette densities:
