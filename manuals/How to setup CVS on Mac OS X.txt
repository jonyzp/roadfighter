Compiling and installing the CVS server software:
Mac OS X itself comes with CVS, so no need to do it yourself.

Configuring the CVS repository:
sudo mkdir /usr/local/CVS/ 
sudo cvs -d /usr/local/CVS/ init

Configuring and restarting xinetd:
If the directory /etc/xinetd.d/ exists, then xinetd is installed on your computer and you should use it. 
Create a file called cvspserver with this inside:
service cvspserver 
{
	disable = no 
	socket_type = stream 
	wait = no user = root 
	server = /usr/bin/cvs 
	server_args = -f --allow-root=/usr/local/CVS pserver 
	groups = yes 
	flags = REUSE 
}
If the file /var/run/xinetd.pid exists (xinetd is running), then do this to restart it: 
	sudo kill -HUP `cat /var/run/xinetd.pid` 
If the file /var/run/xinetd.pid does not exist (xinetd is not running), then do this to start it: 
	sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/IPServices/IPServices start 
	
Password CVS access: 
All you need to do, is create a file called passwd in your repository (in this case /usr/local/CVS/CVSROOT/passwd) 
with entries on each line for each user with their username, hash password
e.g passwd file
	name:password
	waqqas:iy34rf83nfn

Generate hashes using OpenSSL:
	openssl passwd 
	Password: 123 
	Verifying -	 Password: 123
	yrp85EUNQl01E
 
 Configuring your client
 	export CVSROOT=:pserver:username@ipaddress.domain.com:/usr/local/CVS
 
Populating repository:
	mkdir myproj
	cd myproj
	
Import command usage:
	cvs -d cvs repository import -m "message" nameofmodule vendortag releasetag
	cvs -d /usr/local/cvs import -m "My First Project" myproj vendor-tag start

Checkout CVS repository:
	cvs checkout modulename
